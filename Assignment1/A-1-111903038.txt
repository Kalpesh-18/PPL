Answers:
	1) The declarations in GIMPLE are showcased in a much more simple way although the declaration syntax is similar but if there are multiple declaration and initialization on same line then they get segregated into declaration on different lines.Initializers are broken  up into simple    declarations at the top .There is no  declaration for global  variables; they are used directly.The global decleration int Z does not get declared in the same way in GIMPLE it is declared in output file. It is declared when z is again mentioned in the program
eg - int a, b, c; gets converted to  int a;
 				      int b;
				      int c;
	   
	2) A temporary variable is created which is assigned a value according to precedence of function Here the value assigned is of a*b which is then added up with 25 and then value is assigned to variable c. A temporary variable is created when more than one different function are used in a single expression
	    eg - c = a * b + 25 is represented as
		_1 = a * b;
		c = _1 + 25;
 	
	3) The float number is represented with just one digit on the left side of decimal and it is represented in term of (10 raised to something) and a temporary variable is assigned the value of integer value of	     the float number and afterward the decimal part is added which is then assigned to a permanent variable.
	     eg - Float number r = 34.5 is represented as
		r = 3.45e+1;

	4) In the statement Z = Z + 1 the value of Z is getting modified by using the previous value of Z hence a temporary variable is created While as for [q = Z] the value is directly assigned to variable q Also GIMPLE statements can have at most one operation, the only type of  statements involving globals are of the form GLOBAL = LOCAL or LOCAL = GLOBAL.
